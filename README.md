- View and get value from their data easily
- Have direct control of their data

- Collaboration

Change can only come from working together. 

- Education/Awareness: 

## Notes on values

- Consent
  - Consent should be revocable.
  - Consent should be respected.
  - Consent should be informed.
  - Consent should be a choice (not forced).
  - Consent should be opt-out by default.
- Respect individual rights/Ownership
  - Right to know about what is done with their data.
  - Right to control the distribution of their data.
  - Lawful processing of their data e.g. respecting GDPR.
- Privacy
  - Right to privacy.
  - Data is valuable asset.
  - Data can be used to control people in malicious way e.g. Turkey, China, CambridgeAnalytica, Russia.
- Fairness
  - Wealth earned from data is evenly distributed to data owners.
- Collaboration

## How

We're going to make this happen by:

- Showing companies a better way to be GDPR compliant.
- Informing government that people care about this issue.
- etc etc

## How you can help
What we're looking for:
- Fantastic organisations already working on these problems
- Open-source developers to contribute to our libraries
- Passionate individuals sharing & spreading our message

What/How we will do:
- Provide a movement concerned individuals can join
- Unite common interest groups already working on this issue
- Clearly explain the current problems & help to educate people of what their data is
- Encourage collaboration between all members o


We aim to support and campaign for a world where the individual is able to easily view and control their data, by encouraging companies and governments to put in place policies that facilitate this. As part of this, we want to unite the many organisations, projects and individuals concerned with data rights and data ethics, and help them collaborate, share with and empower each other.

We believe that by connecting, cooperating and working together, pooling our resources and influence, we can make more change than if we work separately - the more people and organisations we can get taking steps which put the human being as the priority in the personal data discussion, the more likely we are to create a world which does the same.

Currently, the world doesn’t operate with the assumption that the individual should truly be in control of their data. Personal data rights are and will be a battleground between people and corporations. We think this movement will help bring about an improvement in data ethics and personal control over our data, by helping data-positive projects (ones which put the individuals in control of their data) succeed, and making it easy for companies to adopt better data practices.
Mission Statement

The Good Data movement aims to link together and multiply the impact of projects that aim to change the data economy in favour of users. We will be working to solve the problem of consent and control of people’s personal data, and to increase the distributional equity of the gains from data wealth. In addition to putting control where it should be, we also believe there will be positive and broad economic benefits to putting data in individuals’ control, through facilitating better-informed and more valuable data transactions.

A key part of ensuring everyone’s data rights are respected and facilitated by companies, governments and websites will be campaigning for people’s rights collectively by formalising and expressing coherently the desire that many people share to control their data.
Why?

Because there isn't anything like this 
Objectives?

- Ethically sourced
- Consent controls
- Used for a good cause

We will be campaigning for transparency about data collection from companies, aiming to change company policies and norms to prioritise user control of their data, and aiming to expose and change bad data practices.
Values?

Look at similar non-profit.
