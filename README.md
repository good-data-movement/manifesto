# The Good Data Movement manifesto.

We are working towards a future where peopleâ€™s data consent choices are informed & respected, data is used for the benefit of everyone, and data owners receive a share of the value their data produces.

## What is the Good Data Movement?

The Good Data Movement is a social movement, an Open-source community-led organisation, and a campaign group for fair, ethical and non-exploitative data use.

We aim to consolidate and act as a central reference point for the many people feeling concerned with how litte control they have over how their data is used, and to unite the efforts of individuals and organisations working to advance the potential social benefits of **good** data use. 

## Why Good Data Movement?
<!--Why is this movement necessary?-->

- Because even after continued exploitation nothing has changed.
- Because the problem is too large for any individual to make a difference.
- Because a movement can consolidate existing information and efforts.
- Because change can only come from working together. 
- Because there isn't anything like this.

## Aims

### For individuals to:

- Know where their data is, how it is used, and what it means.
- Make informed consent choices that are respected.
- Get dividends from any value generated from their data.

### For companies to:

- Subscribe to the Good Data Alliance guidelines.
- Ensure individuals data is kept private.
- Provide clear consent options with opt-out as default.
- Question the source from which they obtain data.
- Recognise the benefits of treating customers well<sup><a id='a1' href='#1'>1</a></sup>.

## Ethi

The Good Data Movement is set up & currently directed by George Punter, who is also a Co-Founder of the Company Ethi Technologies Limited.
We are actively looking for dedicated & passionate people to join the board of Directors of the Good Data Movement, to help ensure it is kept free of any conflict of interest with Ethi Technologies Limited.

Ethi's aims are a for-profit attempt to raise awareness & give people more control over their personal data.

The Ethi Control Panel will:
- Provide visualisation tools for users to _see_ what companies know about them.
- Facilitate sending automated requests-for-data and following up data deletion requests to give people _control_.
- Allowing users to share their data anonymously with trusted 3rd parties with **fully transparent** _opt-in_ consent controls, finally giving users access to the monetary _value_ that their data holds.

Our goal is that by providing these tools, we will wake up people as to how their personal data is being exploited, give them back control, and share with them the value of their data - providing a better data-future & improving the data economy.

Ethi plans to be an active contributor to various open-source software projects hosted here concerning personal data.
