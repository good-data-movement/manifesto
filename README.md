# The Good Data Movement is a campaign group for fair, ethical and non-exploitative data use.
We are working towards a future where peopleâ€™s data consent choices are informed & respected, data is used for the benefit of everyone, and data owners receive a share of the value their data produces.

### We want to help you get back control over your data.
We've started this organisation to act as a reference point for the many people feeling concerned with the lack of control they have over how their data is gathered and used, and to unite the efforts of individuals and organisations working to advance the social benefits of good data use. 

### We want to help you understand why your data is valuable to companies.
Then you can decide for yourself if you're happy for them to use it for free or for a price. We believe that when the user is the product, not the customer, they should get to ask for a share of the profit.

### We want to help Organisations keep their users' data safe.
We recognise there's a heavy burden on organisations to comply with data protection regulations. We want to help organisations continue creating innovate products and research with a privacy-first mindset, and show you how being compliant can _benefit_ your business.
