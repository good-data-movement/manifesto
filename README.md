# The Good Data Movement is a campaign group for fair, ethical and non-exploitative data use.

### We want to help you get back control over your data.
We've started this organisation this organisation to act as a reference point for the many people feeling concerned with the lack of control they have over how their data is gathered and used, and to unite the efforts of individuals and organisations working to advance the social benefits of good data use. 

### We want to help you understand why your data is valuable to companies.
Then you can decide for yourself if you're happy for them to use it for free or for a price. We believe that when the user is the product, not the customer, they should get to ask for a share of the profit.

### We want to help you keep your users data safe.
We recognise there's a heavy burden on companies to comply with data protection regulations. We want to help you continue creating innovate products and research with a privacy-first mindset, and show you how being compliant doesn't have to be hard.

## Everything we do is and will be driven by these core values:
- Kindness
- Respect
- Honesty
- Fairness
- Transparency
- Working Together / Collaboration?

## If you're already working on these problems, [let us know](CONTRIBUTING.md)!
We're looking for fantastic, passionate organisations and individuals who are either already working on these problems, happy to share the message, or willing to contribute. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## What's the difference between the movement and Ethi?

The Good Data Movement is set up & currently directed by George Punter, who is also a Co-Founder of the Company Ethi Technologies Limited.

We are actively looking for dedicated & passionate people to join the board of Directors of the Good Data Movement, to help ensure it is kept free of any conflict of interest with Ethi Technologies Limited.

Ethi's aims are a for-profit attempt to raise awareness & give people more control over their personal data.

The Ethi Control Panel will provide a paid service to:
- Provide visualisation tools for users to _see_ what companies know about them
- Facilitate sending automated requests for data and following up data deletion requests
- Allowing users to sell their anonymized data to trusted 3rd parties with fully transparent opt-in consent controls.

Our goal is that by providing these tools, we will help educate you as to how your personal data is being exploited, give you back control, and share its value with you - providing a better data-future & improving the data economy.

Ethi plans to be an active contributor to various open-source software projects hosted here concerning personal data.
