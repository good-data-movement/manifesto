# The Good Data Movement manifesto.

We are working towards a future where peopleâ€™s data-rights are respected, and data is used for good.

## Why Good Data Movement?
<!--Why is this movement necessary:-->

- Because even after continued exploitation nothing has changed.
- Because the problem is too large for any individual to make a difference.
- Because a movement can consolidate existing information and efforts.
- Because change can only come from working together. 
- Because there isn't anything like this.

## Aims

### For individuals to:

- Know where their data is, how it is used, and what it means.
