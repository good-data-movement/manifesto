## Prose

We aim to support and campaign for a world where the individual is able to easily view and control their data, by encouraging companies and governments to put in place policies that facilitate this. As part of this, we want to unite the many organisations, projects and individuals concerned with data rights and data ethics, and help them collaborate, share with and empower each other.

We believe that by connecting, cooperating and working together, pooling our resources and influence, we can make more change than if we work separately - the more people and organisations we can get taking steps which put the human being as the priority in the personal data discussion, the more likely we are to create a world which does the same.

Currently, the world doesn’t operate with the assumption that the individual should truly be in control of their data. Personal data rights are and will be a battleground between people and corporations. We think this movement will help bring about an improvement in data ethics and personal control over our data, by helping data-positive projects (ones which put the individuals in control of their data) succeed, and making it easy for companies to adopt better data practices.

Mission Statement

The Good Data movement aims to link together and multiply the impact of projects that aim to change the data economy in favour of users. We will be working to solve the problem of consent and control of people’s personal data, and to increase the distributional equity of the gains from data wealth. In addition to putting control where it should be, we also believe there will be positive and broad economic benefits to putting data in individuals’ control, through facilitating better-informed and more valuable data transactions.

A key part of ensuring everyone’s data rights are respected and facilitated by companies, governments and websites will be campaigning for people’s rights collectively by formalising and expressing coherently the desire that many people share to control their data.

We are making the organisation because lots of people are becoming more aware of these issues and efforts to solicit change are stifled by a lack of cohesion or existence of a social movement which they can join, and the problem is too large for any lone individual to have an effect.
