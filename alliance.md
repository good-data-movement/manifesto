# The Good Data Alliance
Uniting organisations who follow ethics-based community guidelines for the handling of personal data.

## What is the Good Data Alliance?

GDA is a group of companies certified as following the [_GDA Guidelines_](./guidelines.md).

The [_GDA Guidelines_](./guidelines.md) are community-led guidelines based on what people believe are best & ethical practices for the handling of personal data, and will be constructed & refined through democratic & open-source efforts.

These guidelines, besides benefitting the users whose data is held by GDA-certified companies, should help companies to be more clear on best practices for securing their customers' data & earning trust.  
The [_Good Data Movement_](https://github.com/good-data-movement) community will seek to develop open-source tools and gather existing knowledge & tools into one place, making it easier for companies to be legally & ethically compliant, and beyond that, provide a **good** experience for their users.
